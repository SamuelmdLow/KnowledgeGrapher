Brambli is a community for sharing knowledge graphs. The hope is that this is a more optimized way of inputing and presenting information for the associative nature of human memory

## How it works
Concepts are represented as nodes and the edges connecting them represent the relationship between nodes. These relationships can have names such as "is a subset of". Every node can be inspected to reveal a description. It is hoped that emphasizing concepts and relationships, and presenting them spacially will aid memory.
Some key features Brambli includes is a Guided view which gives an order for navigating the graph. As the user scrolls they can a node's descriptions on the right and the graph on the left will have that node fade in with the graph panning to focus on it. Unlike most other graph based learning tools, this means that Brambli is capable of both linear and non-linear learning. I believe that is important because non-linear learning can feel intimdating and does not fit every field of study.
